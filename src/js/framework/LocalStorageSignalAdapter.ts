/**
 * Creates a localstorage adapter around the provided signal and returns the signal.
 * It:
 *  - sets the initial value of the signal to the value stored in localstorage. 
 *     If you have any listeners attached to the signal, they will be called 
 *     with this value. Therefore, it is intended that this adapter is used 
 *     before any listeners are attached to the signal.
 *     If any value was assigned to the signal, it will be _replaced_.
 *   - stores the value of the signal in localstorage any time the signal is updated.
 * @param signal any signal-compliant object
 * @param localStorageKey a unique string to identify the value in localstorage
 * @returns the signal passed.
